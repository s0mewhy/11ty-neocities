            <p>If interested in commissioning me, shoot me a message one of these places:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>s0mewhy.art@gmail.com</strong></li>
                <li><a class="tumblr" href="https://tumblr.com/s0mewhy">s0mewhy@tumblr</a></li>
                <li><a class="bsky" href="https://bsky.app/profile/s0mewhy.bsky.social">s0mewhy@bsky.app</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>To start, I'll need: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>A detailed description of the subject and scene.</strong> For characters, some notes
                    about their life and personality are helpful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>At least 3 reference images.</strong> References for faces, outfits, poses, and
                    settings are useful, even little doodles. Anything that helps me understand your vision.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Figure drawing is my strong suit, and I'm open to drawing artistic nudity, suggestive themes, and gore.
                Don't hesitate to reach out with an idea, although I may decline if it's too far outside my wheelhouse.
                Please respect my right to refuse a commission for any reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will provide an estimate based on the details of the request. Commissions requiring extra complexity,
                additional characters, or larger formats will have a higher overall cost due to the additional work
                involved. After we negotiate pricing, I will email you an invoice via PayPal with payment options.
                Full payment upfront; no refunds. (I will refund you if I'm not able to finish the commission.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon receipt of payment and references, I can begin work. I prefer to send sketches as I
                plan the composition and more final versions near the end. If you want major changes to the subject or
                scene, please let me know early on!
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy experimenting with different styles, so my approach may vary from piece to piece. If you have a
                specific style in mind, especially one I've done in the past, please let me know. Alternatively, if you
                would like me to just go crazy, please let me know as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on my workload, complexity of the commission, and communication, it may take up to <strong>3
                    months</strong> to complete your piece. The final artwork will be provided as a flattened
                <strong>A4-size 400dpi
                    PNG file</strong> unless otherwise specified.
            </p>

                it to
